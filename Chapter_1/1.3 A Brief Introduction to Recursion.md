### What is Recursion?

Recursion refers to defining a function in terms of itself. This approach can simplify problem-solving when a problem can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

Example:

- Function \( f \):
  - \( f(0) = 0 \)
  - \( f(x) = 2f(x-1) + x^2 \)
- Values:
  - \( f(1) = 1 \)
  - \( f(2) = 6 \)
  - \( f(3) = 21 \)
  - \( f(4) = 58 \)

Recursive functions rely on two critical components:

1. **Base Case**: The stopping condition for the recursion.

2. **Recursive Step**: A call to the function itself with a smaller input that progresses toward the base case.

#### Example Code

**Recursive Function Definition**:

```cpp
int f(int x) {
  if (x == 0)
    return 0;
  else
    return 2 * f(x - 1) + x * x;
}
```

- **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \)
- **Recursive Step**: \( f(x) = 2f(x-1) + x^2 \)

#### Recursive Problem-Solving Examples

1. **Dictionary Lookup**:
   - Look up a word.
   - If you donâ€™t understand the definition, recursively look up unfamiliar words until you find one you understand or encounter a circular definition.

2. **Printing Numbers**:
   - Task: Print digits of a number \( n \) using recursion.
   - **Steps**:
     - Base Case: Print the digit directly if \( n \) is a single digit.
     - Recursive Step: Print all digits except the last using \( n/10 \), then print the last digit using \( n \% 10 \).

**Code**:

```cpp
void printOut(int n) {
  if (n >= 10)
    printOut(n / 10);
  printDigit(n % 10);
}
```

#### Rules of Recursion

1. **Base Cases**:
   - Ensure a base case exists to stop recursion.

2. **Making Progress**:
   - Recursive calls must always move closer to the base case.

3. **Design Rule**:
   - Assume that all recursive calls work correctly.

4. **Avoid Duplication**:
   - Never solve the same subproblem multiple times.

---

#### Pros and Cons of Recursion

**Advantages**:

- Simplifies algorithm design.
- Produces cleaner and more readable code.

**Disadvantages**:

- Hidden bookkeeping costs due to maintaining the call stack.
- Inefficient for problems that involve repeated calculations (e.g., Fibonacci numbers).

**Best Practice**:

- Avoid recursion for problems where iterative solutions are simpler or more efficient.
