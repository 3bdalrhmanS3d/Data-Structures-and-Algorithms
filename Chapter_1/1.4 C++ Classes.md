## C++ Classes

This document introduces C++ classes, their syntax, and key concepts for building data structures.

### What is a Class?

- A class in C++ defines a blueprint for objects.
- A class contains:
  - **Data members**: Variables that hold data for the object.
  - **Member functions (methods)**: Functions that act on the object.
- **Instance**: An individual object created from a class.

#### 1.4.1 Basic Class Syntax

- Members of a class can be either **public** or **private**:
  - **Public**: Accessible from outside the class.
  - **Private**: Accessible only by methods of the same class.
- By default, members are private unless explicitly labeled.

**Example: IntCell Class**

The `IntCell` class simulates an integer memory cell.

```cpp
/**
 * A class for simulating an integer memory cell.
 */
class IntCell {
public:
    /**
     * Construct the IntCell with an initial value of 0.
     */
    IntCell() {
        storedValue = 0;
    }

    /**
     * Construct the IntCell with an initial value.
     */
    IntCell(int initialValue) {
        storedValue = initialValue;
    }

    /**
     * Return the stored value.
     */
    int read() {
        return storedValue;
    }

    /**
     * Change the stored value to x.
     */
    void write(int x) {
        storedValue = x;
    }

private:
    int storedValue;
};
```

#### Key Features of Classes

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - Combines data and methods into a single unit.
   - Ensures internal details are hidden (information hiding).

2. **Access Modifiers**:
   - Public: Allows external access.
   - Private: Restricts access to internal use.

3. **Constructors**:
   - Special methods for initializing objects.
   - If no constructor is defined, a default constructor is generated.
   - Example:
     - `IntCell()` initializes `storedValue` to 0.
     - `IntCell(int initialValue)` initializes `storedValue` with the provided value.

4. **Methods**:
   - Define the behavior of the class.
   - Example:
     - `read()` returns the current value.
     - `write(int x)` updates the value.

#### 1.4.4 Vector and String

- The **vector** and **string** classes in C++ Standard Library (STL) replace the limitations of built-in arrays and strings:
  - Built-in arrays lack features such as copying, size awareness, and index validation.
  - Built-in strings are arrays of characters with similar limitations.

**Advantages of STL Vector and String**:

- Vectors know their size and can dynamically adjust it.
- Strings and vectors support:
  - Relational operators (e.g., `==`, `<`).
  - Copying with `=`.

**Using Vectors**:

- Example: Creating a vector of perfect squares:

  ```cpp
  #include <vector>
  #include <iostream>

  int main() {
      std::vector<int> squares;
      for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
          squares.push_back(i * i);
      }

      for (int x : squares) {
          std::cout << x << " ";
      }
  }
  ```

- Initializing a vector:

  - Pre-C++11:

    ```cpp
    std::vector<int> daysInMonth(12);
    daysInMonth[0] = 31; daysInMonth[1] = 28; ...
    ```

  - C++11:

    ```cpp
    std::vector<int> daysInMonth = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
    ```

  - Uniform initialization (C++11+):

    ```cpp
    std::vector<int> daysInMonth {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
    ```

  - Ambiguity in initialization:

    - `std::vector<int> daysInMonth {12};` creates a vector of size 1 with element `12`.
    - To create a vector of size 12, use parentheses: `std::vector<int> daysInMonth(12);`

**Range-Based Loops** (C++11):

- Simplifies iteration over vectors:

  ```cpp
  int sum = 0;
  for (auto x : squares) {
      sum += x;
  }
  ```

- Use range-for only when sequential access is needed and the index is not required.

**Using Strings**:

- Strings support relational operators and have methods like `length()` to determine their size.

- Example:

  ```cpp
  std::string str1 = "hello";
  std::string str2 = "world";

  if (str1 != str2) {
      std::cout << "Strings are not equal.";
  }
  ```

This foundational understanding of C++ classes, vectors, and strings ensures robust and efficient programming.
